        <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <div class="description">
                <p>I want to train neural networks (NNs) to predict the Academy Awards winners given the
                        nominees for this year. I will specifically aim for predicting the "Best Picture" award 
                        by creating and using a dataset of previous nominees and winners and how they fared in 
                        earlier awards shows (e.g., SAGs, Golden Globes, BAFTA, etc.). I am not sure yet what else
                        plays a role in who gets the Academy Award for "Best Picture," but I will look more into
                        that, as a part of the initial/preparation stages of my project. I am thinking about testing
                        the NN by feeding it data from 1947 to 2017 and making it "predict" the winners of 2018,
                        2019, and 2020 (which we already know). If the NN is able to predict at least one of them
                        accurately, I will deploy it as an application and see what it predicts will be the winner
                        this year (2021). If not, I will continue working on improving the model and the data that I am
                        using for the predictions. This work can potentially be extended by training the NN to 
                        predict other categories, such as "Best Director," "Best Actor," "Best Actress," etc. (which
                        will likely depend on a different set of data).
