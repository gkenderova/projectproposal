        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>I want to train neural networks (NNs) to predict the Academy Awards winners given the
            nominees for this year. I will specifically aim for predicting the "Best Picture" award 
            by creating and using a dataset of previous nominees and winners and how they fared in 
            earlier awards shows (e.g., SAGs, Golden Globes, BAFTA, etc.).
        </p>
        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Learn how voting works</li>
            <li>Pick data to be used to predict "Best Picture."</li>
            <li>Scrape data for nominees and winners and make one dataset.</li>
            <li>Predict the "Best Picture" winner for 2021.</li>
        </ol>
