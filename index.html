        <h1>Predicting the Oscars</h1>

        <h2>Project Description</h2>
        <p>I want to train neural networks (NNs) to predict the Academy Awards winners given the
            nominees for this year. I will specifically aim for predicting the "Best Picture" award 
            by creating and using a dataset of previous nominees and winners and how they fared in 
            earlier awards shows (e.g., SAGs, Golden Globes, BAFTA, etc.). I am thinking about testing
            the NN by feeding it data from 1947 to 2017 and making it "predict" the winners of 2018,
            2019, and 2020 (which we already know). If the NN is able to predict at least one of them
            accurately, I will deploy it as an application and see what it predicts will be the winner
            this year. This work can potentially be extended by training the NN to predict other
            categories, such as "Best Director," "Best Actor," "Best Actress," etc.

        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Learn how voting works</li>
            <li>Pick data to be used to predict "Best Picture."</li>
            <li>Scrape data for nominees and winners and make one dataset.</li>
            <li>Predict the "Best Picture" winner for 2021.</li>
        </ol>
